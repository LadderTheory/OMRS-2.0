//You can press Alt + z to get the text to wrap around within the VScode window, so you don't have to scroll along all the text as a single line of code.
//This is where the text is declared. The text itself will fill the text box naturally as a single paragraph, but if you want to add line breaks for indentation or to separate paragraphs, add a "\n" to indicate that break.
const text = 'This file will explain the process to create and save a mission.\n\n-Step 1. Once logged in, the default landing page should be the "Missions List" page. In the navigation bar at the top of the page, click the link for "New Airlift Mission".\n-Step 2. On this page, there will be input fields for all relevant misison data. Several fields here will be in the form of drop-down menus that are pre-populated with informaiton, such as the aircraft that was flown, the squadron flying the mission, etc.\n-Step 3. When the overall information has been entered, click the "New Leg" button to add a new leg. Next, click the button that is generated to expand the field. This field will be much like the overall mission information, with several more dropdown menus and input boxes. Some of the information, however, will be dynamically filled in based off of your inputs. ex. the passengers, cargo, and pallets through fields will be filled in based on the inputs from the on/off fields.\n-Step 4. If more than one leg is necessary for a given mission, simply click "New Leg" again for each leg, and repeat step 3.\n-Step 5. Once all information has been enterd and checked for accuracy(see note), click the "Save Mission" button. This will save the mission to the database, and a message should appear to confirm this.\n-Note: If legs need to be deleted(such as if you have legs 1, 2, and 3, and need to delete leg 1 or 2) then after deleting the legs, click the "Reorder Legs" button. This will reset the leg numbering so they are properly labeled.'
