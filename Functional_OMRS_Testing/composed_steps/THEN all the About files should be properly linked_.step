step-def: Then all the About files should be properly linked.

    step: When I click the element <<name=createMission>>
    step: Then the text of element <<id=aboutTextArea>> should be <<{{textMatchExpression}}>>
        var textMatchExpression = <<
            This file will explain the process to create and save a mission.
            
            -Step 1. Once logged in, the default landing page will be the "Missions List" page. In the navigation bar at the top of the page, click the link for "New Airlift Mission".
            
            -Step 2. On this page, there will be input fields for all relevant mission data. Several fields here will be in the form of drop-down menus that are pre-populated with information, such as the aircraft that was flown, the squadron flying the mission, etc.
            
            -Step 3. When the overall information has been entered, click the "New Leg" button to add a new leg. Next, click the button that is generated to expand the field. This field will be much like the overall mission information, with several more dropdown menus and input boxes. Some of the information, however, will be dynamically filled in based off of your inputs. ex. the passengers, cargo, and pallets through fields will be filled in based on the inputs from the on/off fields.
            
            -Note: When filling in the calculated data fields, it is still possible to manually edit the final field. If, after manually changing these fields, you want to go back to the calculated value, simply re-enter the data in the first two boxes, then tab or click into the final box. This will re-calculate the value.
            
            -Step 4. If more than one leg is necessary for a given mission, simply repeat Step 3 for each new leg that is required.
            
            -Step 5. Once all information has been enterd and checked for accuracy(see note), click the "Save Mission" button. This will save the mission to the database, and a message should appear to confirm this.
            
            -Note: If legs need to be deleted(such as if you have legs 1, 2, and 3, and need to delete leg 1 or 2) then after deleting the legs, click the "Reorder Legs" button. This will reset the leg numbering so they are properly labeled.

    step: When I click the element <<name=viewMission>>
    step: Then the text of element <<id=aboutTextArea>> should be <<{{textMatchExpression}}>>
        var textMatchExpression = <<
            This file will explain how to view and edit a created mission.
            
            -Step 1. Once logged in, the default landing page will be the "Missions List" page. This is a list of missions that exist in the database. Mission in the list are identified by the Callsign entered during mission creation.
            
            -Step 2. Also on this page are several boxes to select a filter to search for specific missions. To search for a specific date range, enter the dates in the two calendar boxes at the top of the page. To search by a specific squadron, simply select that squadron from the dropdown menu right below the calendar boxes.
            
            -Step 3. When a mission is selected, then the information from that mission will be displayed to the right of the list.
            
            Editing Missions
            
            -Step 1. Once you have a mission selected, and you want to edit it, click the "Edit" button at the bottom of the displayed information. This will open up a page similar to the "New Airlift Mission" page, but will have all the relevant mission information pre-populated.
            
            -Step 2. Once you go through the mission and edit any fields that are necessary(see note), click the "Save Mission" button. This will save the changes made without creating a new mission.
            
            -Note: It is also possible at this step to add new legs, if necessary. The process to add legs here is identical to Step 3 in the "Creating Missions" file.
            
            -Note: When filling in the calculated data fields in each of the legs, it is still possible to manually edit the final field. If, after manually changing these fields, you want to go back to the calculated value, simply re-enter the data in the first two boxes, then tab or click into the final box. This will re-calculate the value.
            
            Note: If legs need to be deleted(such as if you have legs 1, 2, and 3, and need to delete leg 1 or 2) then after deleting the legs, click the "Reorder Legs" button. This will reset the leg numbering so they are properly labeled.
